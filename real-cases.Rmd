abstract:
  In a pandemic such as this one, it's impossible to ascertain the real number of cases except by testing the whole population; this leads to the problem of different death rates for different countries, but mainly to the more poignant problem of allocating resources for urgent and grave cases or assessing the local peak of the epidemic. In this report we will try to find out an estimate of the death rate by looking at the countries that have made a more extensive testing, like Germany or South Korea. We will first try to estimate the time from onset to outcome, and from that, we will try and give an estimate of cases (and possible deaths) in other countries where testing has not been so extensive, like Spain.
